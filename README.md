My Raspberry Pi Tools
=====================

Infrared Transmitter based on IR Slinger
----------------------------------------

I want to thank bschwind@github.com for his great code. Since I want to have a simple tool
box for my Raspberry Pi, I ripped all out of the repo which is not necessary for my intended usage.

My LED stribe is controlled with cron and changes brightness and colors depending on the time.
To install the tool in the system, simply call `sudo ./install.sh`. Please be aware that this
script overwrites any existing cron tab entries!
